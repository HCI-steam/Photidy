# Photidy

## Setup

1. Setup development environment and install requirements  by following [expo documentation](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/)
2. Clone this project to your local directory.
3. Install dependencies and run the project

```bash
yarn install 
# or
npm install

# then

expo start # dev server start
```

maybe you can run it by using simulator (both of `android` and `ios`), but, I'll recommend you run it on your own device.
please install `Expo go` on your device, and run it by using the expo app.
